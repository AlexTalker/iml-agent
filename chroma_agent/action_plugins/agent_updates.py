    This is an incomplete solution but the incompleteness is at the bottom of the stack and we need this as a fix up

    What really needs to happen here is that the profile contains the name of the packages to install and then this
    code would diff the old list and the new list and remove and add appropriately. For now we are just going to do that
    in a hard coded way using the managed property.

    To do this properly the profile needs to contain the packages and the endpoint needs to return them. We are going to
    need it and when we do this function and profiles will need to be extended.

    This code might want to use the update_pacakges as well but it's not clear and we are in a pickle here. This code is
    not bad and doesn't have bad knock on effects.
